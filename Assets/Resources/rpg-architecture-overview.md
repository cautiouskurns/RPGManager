# RPG Progression Simulator - Architectural Overview

## Core Architecture Approach

For this systems-focused RPG simulator, I recommend a hybrid architecture combining **Event-driven design** with **Scriptable Object-based configuration** and **MVC patterns** for UI elements. While full ECS (Entity Component System) might be overkill for this simulation-focused project, we can adopt some of its principles for specific subsystems.

## System Organization

### 1. Core Framework Layer

**Simulation Core**
- `SimulationManager` (Singleton): Orchestrates the entire simulation loop
- `EventBus`: Central event dispatcher using ScriptableObject-based events
- `DataPersistence`: Handles saving/loading simulation state
- `LoggingService`: Records all simulation events for analysis

### 2. Data Layer (ScriptableObjects)

**Configuration ScriptableObjects**
- `ProgressionConfigSO`: XP curves, level thresholds
- `CombatConfigSO`: Combat formulas, damage calculations
- `LootTablesSO`: Item generation probabilities, rarity weights
- `EnemyDefinitionsSO`: Enemy templates and scaling
- `StatConfigSO`: Base stat ranges and growth rates

**Runtime ScriptableObjects (for Events)**
- `CharacterLevelUpEventSO`
- `CombatResultEventSO`
- `LootAcquiredEventSO`
- `EquipmentChangedEventSO`

### 3. Model Layer (Domain Entities)

**Core Models**
- `Character`: Contains character state and delegates to specialized systems
- `Stats`: Immutable struct for character/enemy statistics
- `Item`: Base class for equipment with inheritance or composition for types
- `Enemy`: Enemy entity definition

### 4. Systems Layer (Service-oriented)

**Character System**
- `CharacterFactory`: Creates and initializes characters
- `LevelSystem`: Handles XP gain and level progression
- `InventorySystem`: Manages item storage and organization

**Combat System**
- `CombatResolver`: Pure logic class that determines combat outcomes
- `DamageCalculator`: Specialized class for damage formulas
- `CombatEventGenerator`: Creates narrative events from combat

**Loot System**
- `LootGenerator`: Creates items based on configuration
- `RarityResolver`: Calculates item rarity and properties
- `EquipmentOptimizer`: Determines optimal equipment loadouts

**Narrative System**
- `NarrativeManager`: Generates story events based on simulation
- `EventInterpreter`: Converts simulation data to narrative elements
- `QuestGenerator`: Creates dynamic objectives based on character progress

### 5. UI Layer (MVC Pattern)

**Views**
- `CharacterView`: Displays character stats and equipment
- `CombatLogView`: Shows combat results and history
- `InventoryView`: Displays and allows interaction with items
- `SimulationControlView`: Controls for running/configuring the simulation

**Controllers**
- `CharacterViewController`: Bridges character model and view
- `SimulationController`: UI-facing simulation controls
- `LogViewController`: Manages filtering and display of simulation logs

## Event Flow Architecture

I recommend using ScriptableObject-based events to decouple systems:

```
[Combat Event] → EventBus → [Multiple Listeners]
                            ↓             ↓          ↓
                     XP System     Loot System    Narrative System
                        ↓
             [Level Up Event] → EventBus → [Multiple Listeners]
                                           ↓          ↓
                              Stat System   Equipment System
```

## State Management

Since this is a simulation:
- Use immutable data structures where possible
- Implement state transitions via events
- Use serializable snapshots for analysis

## Specific Unity Implementations

### ScriptableObjects Usage
- **Configuration Data**: Store all balancing parameters in SOs
- **Event Channels**: Use SOs as event channels for system communication
- **Factory Templates**: Templates for character/enemy creation

### MonoBehaviour Distribution
- Keep MonoBehaviours minimal - primarily for visualization and UI
- Main simulation logic should be in plain C# classes
- Use MonoBehaviour wrappers for Unity integration when needed

### Optimization Considerations
- Implement object pooling for frequently created entities
- Use Jobs System for batch processing combat simulations
- Consider Burst compiler for math-heavy operations

## Development Approach

1. **Build Core Models First**: Character, Stats, Items as pure C# classes
2. **Implement Event System**: Create the event architecture early
3. **Create Simulation Loop**: Basic loop with minimal systems
4. **Add ScriptableObject Configuration**: Make systems data-driven
5. **Layer in Systems One by One**: Level → Combat → Loot → Narrative
6. **Add UI Last**: Once the simulation runs correctly, add visualization

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Deterministic Simulation**: Use seeded random for reproducible results
2. **System Decoupling**: Systems communicate through events, not direct references
3. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for core systems like combat resolution
4. **Serialization**: Full state can be serialized for analysis or resuming
5. **Extensibility**: Design for adding new stat types, item effects, etc.

By following this architecture, you'll have a maintainable, testable, and scalable foundation for your RPG Progression Simulator that can evolve as requirements change.
