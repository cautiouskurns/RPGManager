# RPG Progression Simulator - Development Phases

Here's a detailed roadmap organized as sequential phases, focusing on having a playable experience at each stage while gradually building out the complete simulation. Each phase adds new systems while ensuring you have something functional to test and evaluate.

## Phase 1: Core Character Framework & Basic Combat
**Duration: 1-2 weeks**

### Objectives:
- Establish core architecture and event system
- Create a functional character with basic stats
- Implement simple deterministic combat
- Develop minimal UI to visualize character progress

### Architectural Elements:
- Basic `SimulationManager`
- Core `EventBus` implementation
- Fundamental `Character` and `Stats` models
- Simple `CombatResolver`
- `ProgressionConfigSO` for basic leveling parameters

### Key Milestones & Tasks:
1. Set up project structure and core managers
2. Implement character creation with configurable base stats
3. Create basic combat system comparing character vs enemy stats
4. Build simple XP and leveling system
5. Develop minimal UI to display character stats and combat results
6. Implement basic logging system to track outcomes

### Playable Experience:
At this stage, you'll be able to observe a character automatically fighting simple enemies with deterministic outcomes. The UI will display basic stats, level progression, and a combat log. You can configure initial character stats and watch multiple combat rounds play out sequentially. No equipment or meaningful choices exist yet, but you'll see the character gradually level up and become stronger through stat increases.

**Key Testing Focus:** Verify that the core loop functions and the leveling curve feels appropriate.

## Phase 2: Inventory & Basic Equipment
**Duration: 1-2 weeks**

### Objectives:
- Implement inventory system
- Create basic equipment with stat bonuses
- Add equipment slots and equipping/unequipping
- Develop equipment comparison logic

### Architectural Elements:
- `InventorySystem` implementation
- `Item` and derived equipment classes
- `EquipmentManager` for handling equipped items
- `ItemConfigSO` for defining equipment templates

### Key Milestones & Tasks:
1. Create item and equipment data structures
2. Implement inventory system with add/remove capabilities
3. Add equipment slots and equipping/unequipping logic
4. Create UI elements for inventory and equipped items
5. Implement auto-equip for better items
6. Update combat calculations to include equipment stats

### Playable Experience:
The character now has an inventory that holds equipment. After combat, basic items appear in the inventory and can be equipped manually through the UI or auto-equipped if better than current gear. You'll see the character's stats change based on equipped items, and combat effectiveness will increase not only through leveling but also through better gear. The simulation still runs automatically, but you can pause between rounds to manage equipment if desired.

**Key Testing Focus:** Balance between stat growth from leveling vs. equipment upgrades.

### Key Milestones & Tasks:
1. Create tiered loot system (Common, Rare, Epic) with appropriate stat ranges
2. Implement enemy variety with different stat priorities
3. Add level-scaling for enemies to maintain challenge
4. Enhance combat calculations to include critical hits and misses
5. Update UI to display enemy information and expected combat difficulty
6. Implement detailed combat log showing stat comparisons and outcomes

### Playable Experience:
Combat becomes more interesting with varied enemies providing different challenges. The loot system now generates equipment of different rarities, with visual indicators in the UI. Player choices start to matter more as equipment trade-offs become meaningful (e.g., more strength vs. more vitality). The simulation provides feedback about enemy difficulty relative to player level. You can observe trends in which enemy types are most challenging for your character build.

**Key Testing Focus:** Enemy difficulty curve and loot distribution balance.

### Key Milestones & Tasks:
1. Replace deterministic combat with probability-based outcomes
2. Implement special item effects (critical hit bonus, dodge chance, etc.)
3. Create item set tracking and bonuses
4. Add combat visualization showing attack sequences and rolls
5. Implement "best in slot" calculations for equipment optimization
6. Create detailed tooltips showing equipment comparisons

### Playable Experience:
Combat feels more dynamic with an element of chance. Equipment choices become more strategic as items have special effects beyond raw stats. The UI now displays detailed breakdowns of combat calculations, letting you understand why outcomes occur. Auto-equip becomes smarter, accounting for special effects and set bonuses. You can observe battles play out with more granular steps rather than just seeing the final result.

**Key Testing Focus:** Balance of RNG vs. character power, and whether special effects feel impactful without being overpowered.

1. Add manual or auto-allocation of stat points on level up
2. Implement character classes with different growth rates
3. Create specialization paths that unlock at certain levels
4. Develop UI for managing build choices
5. Add analytics to track build effectiveness against enemy types
6. Implement build templates and recommendations

### Playable Experience:
The simulator now supports meaningful build diversity. When your character levels up, you can choose how to allocate stat points or select from suggested builds. Different builds perform better against certain enemy types. The analytics section shows how your character performs against the enemy population and suggests improvements. The simulation can now run multiple characters with different builds simultaneously for comparison.

**Key Testing Focus:** Build balance and whether different valid strategies emerge.

## Final Thoughts on Development Approach

- **Continuous Integration:** After each phase, take time to refactor and ensure architectural integrity
- **Progressive Testing:** Set up automated tests for core systems as you build them
- **Player Feedback Loop:** Get feedback on each phase's playable version to inform the next phase
- **Balanced Scope:** Be willing to adjust phase scope based on discoveries during implementation
- **Technical Debt Management:** Schedule specific time for addressing technical debt rather than letting it accumulate

This phased approach ensures you have something playable throughout development while systematically building toward the complete vision. Each phase adds meaningful functionality that can be tested and evaluated independently, allowing you to course-correct as needed based on how the simulation feels in practice.
